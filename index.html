  </h3>      <h1> Worst team in the tournament </h1>
</html> <h2> A 6-1 hammering by Portugal has brought an end to Switzerland's football World Cup adventure in Qatar, with the Swiss media criticising both the tactics of manager Murat Yakin and the performance of the team,
             whose meagre attack was as much to blame as their leaky defence. “Dream over,” summed up the Tages-Anzeiger. </h2>
