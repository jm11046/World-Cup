<h1> World Cup</h1>
  <p>
 <h2> World Cup 2022. The World cup was filled with 32 countries, 60 matches, joy, happiness, sadness, and many other emotions. But overall it was a fun competition.
    It was held in Quatar, and lasted a couple of weeks. In total, there were 172 goals scored, which is a new time record in world cup, surpassin 171 scored in both 1998
    and 2014. There were five penalty shootouts at the 2022 World Cup, the most of any single edition in the history of the competition. Here are some things that have
   happened in the World Cup. </h2>
    
    
  <h1> Best Goal </h1>
  </p> <h2> Kylian Mbappe won the Golden Boot thanks to a hat-trick in the final of FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar, but ended up on the losing side.
       Mbappe and Lionel Messi were both on five goals going into the tournament finale between Argentina and France. </h2>

  </h3>      <h1> Worst team in the tournament </h1>
</html> <h2> A 6-1 hammering by Portugal has brought an end to Switzerland's football World Cup adventure in Qatar, with the Swiss media criticising both the tactics of manager Murat Yakin and the performance of the team,
             whose meagre attack was as much to blame as their leaky defence. “Dream over,” summed up the Tages-Anzeiger. </h2>

<h1> Worst player in the torunament (My opinion) </h1>
<h2> In my opinion, Gareth Bale has not been that great in this World Cup. Even though he is rated 42nd in the best footballers in the world, he hasn't been doing well latley.
     I think he should do better for his country, and he has scored the first goal for Wales in this World Cup in 64 years! </h2>
<h1> Most dissapointing match </h1>
<h2> I think that England vs USA was the most dissapoiting match. It was sad, boring and just a terrible match to watch.
     Barely anything happened in that game, and for a good team like England, most people kind of expected more from them.

  <h1> Most surprising team </h1>  
<h2> Morocco was by far the most surprising team in the tornament. They beat some very good teams like Portugal and even Spain!
     They were the first African team in the tournament to reach the semi-finals. They did brilliant in the tournament, and
     deserved to get that far in the World Cup.

  <h1> Best team in the tournament </h1>
  <h2> According to the public, France have been the best team in the World Cup, and they had won all of their matches untill
    the finals against Argentina. </h2>

  <h1> Best player in the torunament </h1>
<h2> Lionel Messi had played for Argentina and won the World Cup! He has won almost all of the trophies in football history.
     Even though he did not win the Golden Boot, he was brilliant from the start and deserved to win the tournament.
